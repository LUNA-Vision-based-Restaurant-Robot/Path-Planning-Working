# Path-Planning-Working
Path planning algorithms generate a geometric path that passes through pre-defined points, from an initial point to a final point. The algorithm may work in the joint space or in the robot's operating space. Path planning is essential for autonomous mobile robots, including the  Restaurant Robots like LUNA
